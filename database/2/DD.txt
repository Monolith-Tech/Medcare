Based on the provided SOAP note and test results, here is the analysis:

### Subjective:
A 52-year-old male presents with sharp, intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity and improves with rest. He has a history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's symptoms and history suggest a cardiac origin of his complaints, leading to a suspicion of stable angina pectoris.

### Objective:
The test results, however, reveal a different aspect of the patient's health that needs to be addressed:

- **CBC Findings**: Indicate erythrocytosis, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells, and mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia. These findings could suggest an underlying chronic disease, possibly anemia of chronic disease or a specific type of hemoglobinopathy.
- **Liver Panel**: Shows significantly elevated total bilirubin with a predominance of indirect bilirubin, which could indicate hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis as seen in conditions like thalassemia. The liver enzymes AST and ALT are within normal limits, but the high total bilirubin warrants further evaluation for liver function and possible hemolytic processes.

### Assessment:
1. **Primary Assessment for Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath**:
   - Suspected stable angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease is a reasonable initial assessment given the patient's risk factors and symptoms. However, the test results provided do not directly support this diagnosis but rather highlight other potential health issues.

2. **Secondary Findings from Lab Tests**:
   - **Erythrocytosis and Microcytic Hypochromic Anemia**: These findings could suggest a condition like thalassemia minor, especially in the context of the advised Hb HPLC test to rule it out.
   - **Elevated Total Bilirubin**: This could be indicative of hemolysis or liver dysfunction. Given the patient's history and lab results, hemolysis secondary to a hemoglobinopathy like thalassemia could be a consideration.

### Plan:
1. **For Suspected CAD**:
   - Proceed with the scheduled stress test and echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
   - Initiate statin therapy for cholesterol management as planned.
   - Continue with nitroglycerin for chest pain as needed and maintain current medications.
   - Advise lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation.

2. **For Findings from CBC and Liver Panel**:
   - Follow up on the advised Hb HPLC test to rule out thalassemia minor or other hemoglobinopathies.
   - Consider further evaluation for the cause of elevated bilirubin, including direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) to assess for hemolysis, and additional liver function tests if necessary.
   - Referral to a hematologist might be warranted based on the results of the Hb HPLC and further liver function tests.

3. **General Recommendations**:
   - Close monitoring of symptoms and lab values.
   - Education on the importance of adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications.
   - Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review test results and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

### Referrals:
- Cardiologist for further evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease.
- Possibly a hematologist, depending on the outcomes of the Hb HPLC and further evaluations for the elevated bilirubin and erythrocytosis.

This comprehensive approach addresses the immediate concerns related to the patient's cardiac symptoms while also taking into account the significant findings from the lab results that could indicate other underlying conditions.
